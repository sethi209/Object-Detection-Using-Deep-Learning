# Object Detection using MobileNetSSD
This repository contains two Python files for object detection using the MobileNetSSD model and the COCO dataset. One Python file performs object detection on images, while the other file performs object detection on videos.

# Getting Started
To run the object detection code, you will need to install the following libraries:

tensorflow
opencv-python
numpy
After installing the necessary libraries, you can download the MobileNetSSD model from this link. The model files should be placed in the same directory as the Python files.

# Data
The COCO dataset is used for object detection in both the image and video analysis. The dataset contains over 200,000 images and 80 object categories.

# Approach
The object detection is performed using the following steps:

Load the MobileNetSSD model and the COCO dataset.
For image analysis: Load the input image and prepare it for object detection.
For video analysis: Load the video and prepare it for object detection.
Perform object detection on each frame of the input image or video using the MobileNetSSD model.
Draw bounding boxes around the detected objects in the image or video.
Display the resulting image or video with the bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects.

# Results
The object detection using MobileNetSSD model on COCO dataset shows promising results for both image and video analysis. The model is able to detect objects with high accuracy, and the bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects help to identify them clearly.

# Conclusion
This repository demonstrates how to perform object detection using MobileNetSSD model and COCO dataset in Python. The two separate Python files allow for object detection on both images and videos. However, further improvements can be made by using other object detection models or including additional datasets in the analysis.
